# templateforgamesonpygame
this is a template for games you will make with pygame.
it contains:
a model of a square, 50x50 covered in red;
code for keys on keyboard, that make the square move;
comments for explaining everything in there.
if you want to make something of your own with it, you'll probably need to change name of the game, several scripts(2),
that don't work properly, and customize some other things.
you can use this to train and learn the PyGame syntax.
i think that's all, good luck!
